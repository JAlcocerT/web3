Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can have highly volatile prices. The value of a stablecoin is usually tied to (or "pegged" to) a stable asset, such as a government-issued currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold.

### Key Points:
- **Stable value**: The main goal of a stablecoin is to maintain a steady price, usually around $1 USD.
- **Backed by real assets**: To achieve this stability, most stablecoins are backed by reserves, meaning for every stablecoin issued, there is an equivalent amount of the pegged asset (like dollars) held in reserve.

### Examples:
1. **Tether (USDT)**: One of the most popular stablecoins, it is pegged to the US dollar, so 1 USDT is typically equal to $1.
2. **USD Coin (USDC)**: Another stablecoin that is backed by real US dollars in reserve, keeping its value close to $1.
3. **Dai (DAI)**: This stablecoin is a bit different because it's **decentralized and backed by other cryptocurrencies**, but itâ€™s still designed to maintain a stable value close to $1.

In summary, stablecoins provide a way to enjoy the benefits of cryptocurrency (like fast transactions and global use) without the price swings that come with other coins.
