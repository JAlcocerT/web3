This post has been possible thanks to the **fantastic job of FreeCodeCamp** and this video:

This post has the intention to be a consolidation of the personal notes that I have been creating over the SC topic, combined with the knowledge adquired when following their course. A summary for the future me or anyone interested.

## Deploying SC

To deploy a smart contract, you need the following:

* A development environment: Set up an appropriate development environment for writing and testing your smart contract. For Ethereum-based smart contracts, this might involve using tools like Solidity (a programming language for writing smart contracts), Truffle (a development framework), and Ganache (a local blockchain for testing).

* A smart contract: Write your smart contract using a suitable programming language, such as Solidity for Ethereum or Rust for Substrate-based chains. Ensure that your smart contract implements the desired functionality and follows best practices for security and efficiency.

* Testing: Thoroughly test your smart contract using various tools and techniques, such as unit tests, integration tests, and formal verification, to ensure that it behaves as intended and is free from bugs and vulnerabilities.

* Deployment network: Choose a blockchain network for deploying your smart contract. This might be a public blockchain like Ethereum or a permissioned/consortium blockchain, depending on your requirements and the use case.

* Wallet and gas fees: To deploy your smart contract on a blockchain, you need a wallet with a sufficient amount of the native cryptocurrency (e.g., Ether for Ethereum) to cover the gas fees associated with deploying and interacting with the smart contract.

* Deployment tools: Use deployment tools like Truffle, Hardhat, or Remix (for Ethereum) to compile, deploy, and interact with your smart contract on the chosen blockchain network.

* Monitoring and maintenance: Once your smart contract is deployed, you might need to monitor its performance, track transactions, and maintain its functionality by upgrading or updating it, as required.

Keep in mind that deploying a smart contract to a public blockchain like Ethereum is an irreversible action, and any mistakes or vulnerabilities in the code could lead to loss of funds or other adverse consequences. Therefore, it's crucial to follow best practices and ensure that your smart contract is thoroughly tested and reviewed before deployment.



### Alchemy for crypto:

Alchemy is a leading blockchain developer platform, providing infrastructure and tools that make it easier to build and manage decentralized applications (dApps) on multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.

Alchemy offers a suite of developer tools, APIs, and scalable infrastructure to help streamline development and improve the performance of dApps. Alchemy's services are used by many well-known blockchain projects and developers to power their applications.
