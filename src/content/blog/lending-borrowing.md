# Lending and Borrowing




## Example: AAVE

Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables users to **lend and borrow digital assets** on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a non-custodial, open-source platform that allows users to deposit assets into lending pools and earn interest or borrow assets against their deposited collateral. 

**Aave's lending pools** provide an essential source of liquidity to the broader DeFi ecosystem, including DEXs. Traders and arbitrageurs may utilize borrowed assets from Aave to facilitate trades on DEX platforms. Additionally, **Aave's native token, AAVE**, can be traded on various DEXs, allowing users to easily acquire, sell or swap AAVE for other digital assets.

Aave's lending pools can be considered a form of liquidity pool, where users deposit assets to earn interest. These pools enable borrowers to take out loans against their deposited collateral. Although the primary function of Aave's lending pools is to facilitate lending and borrowing, the assets within the pools can also be utilized as a source of liquidity for other DeFi protocols, including AMMs. In some cases, users can even provide liquidity to AMMs by depositing borrowed assets from Aave into AMM liquidity pools, creating a more interconnected DeFi ecosystem.

Its native token, AAVE, which plays a significant role in the protocol's tokenomics:

* Governance: AAVE token holders can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, such as interest rate models, collateral types, and other platform updates.
* Staking: Users can stake AAVE tokens to earn a portion of the protocol's fees and help secure the platform. Stakers also act as a backstop for the system in case of a shortfall event.
* Fee reduction: Borrowers who hold and use AAVE tokens to secure their loans may be eligible for reduced borrowing fees.

Aave's tokenomics design aims to create a sustainable and decentralized ecosystem that incentivizes user participation and ensures the platform's long-term growth.

In summary, Aave is a DeFi lending and borrowing protocol that connects with the broader ecosystem through decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, liquidity pools, and well-designed tokenomics. Aave's lending pools contribute to the overall liquidity in the DeFi space, while its native token, AAVE, encourages users to participate actively in the platform's governance and growth.
